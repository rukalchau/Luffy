# aim of the course
    algorithmic techniques to solve problems
    how to prove correctness of algorithms
    how to model problems

Input Size of Problems (n)

using **asymptotic notation**, which ignores constants and non-dominant 
growth terms

$𝑇(𝑛) =3𝑛^3 +6𝑛^2 −4𝑛+17=Θ(𝑛^3)$

Behavior of some Commonly Encountered Functions
!!!important

Upper bounds.  𝑇𝑛 =𝑂(𝑓(𝑛))
 if exist constants 𝑐>0and 𝑛0>=0such that for all 𝑛>=𝑛0,  𝑇𝑛 ≤𝑐·𝑓(𝑛)

Lower bounds.  𝑇𝑛 =W(𝑓(𝑛)) 
if exist constants 𝑐>0 and 𝑛0>=0 such that for all 𝑛>=𝑛0, 𝑇𝑛 ≥𝑐·𝑓(𝑛).

Tight bounds.  𝑇𝑛 =Q(𝑓(𝑛)) 
if 𝑇𝑛 =𝑂(𝑓(𝑛))	and 𝑇𝑛 =	W(𝑓(𝑛)).
 Note: Here “=” means “is”, not equal.
