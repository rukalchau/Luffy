# Course Outline: Exploring Energy through Experiments

## Course Description
In this engaging and hands-on STEM course, students aged 6-12 will embark on an exploratory journey through the concept of energy. Through a series of 11 experiments, we will investigate different forms of energy, including gravity, water, wind, sound, light, and more. Students will learn the fundamental principles of energy and its applications in the world around us.


## Course Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts of various forms of energy.
- Apply scientific methods to conduct experiments and analyze results.
- Develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills through hands-on activities.
- Foster a sense of curiosity and exploration in the scientific world.

## Course Structure
The course is divided into 11 classes, each focused on a specific aspect of energy. Each class will include a brief lecture, a hands-on experiment, and a discussion/reflection period.
